# Battle for AC-1-11 (FAF Overhaul)

**Battle for AC-1-11** is a large overhaul mod for **Forged Alliance Forever (FAF)**.  
The goal of this mod is to further define all four factions by introducing new units and modifying existing ones.  

**Note**: The mod is still under development, so expect some units to be unbalanced.

## Faction Design Philosophy  

### UEF  
The **UEF** is becoming a hard-hitting but expensive faction.  
- **Key Traits**: Higher unit quality but significantly higher mass costs compared to other factions.  

### Cybran  
The **Cybran** faction is shifting to focus on quantity over quality.  
- **Key Traits**: Units cost much less in mass, emphasizing swarm tactics.  

### Aeon (Planned)  
The **Aeon** faction will revolve around shields as their primary defense mechanism.  
- **Key Traits**:  
  - Most units will have very low base health but rely heavily on shields for protection.  
  - Units will feature a higher overall health pool when shield strength is included, even at **T1**.

## Development Status  
Currently, two factions are temporarily set aside to prioritize faster development for the **UEF** and **Cybran** factions.
